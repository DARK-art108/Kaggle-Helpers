# Kaggle-Helpers
My always imports for maximum Kaggle competitions, dont import in normal projects contain some imports which can't be useful for code can increase space complexity.

* Run `nlp.py` for importing basic and elite imports, you can edit it forwards byv adding custom imports.
* Use `seed.py` function's to create seed in both TF and  Torch enviroment.
